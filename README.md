Analysis and classification of income on census data

### December 2018

<p>This project is a data analysis and machine learning project done on data from a US census. The objective is to classify individuals
in one of two categories: those who earn more than $50,000 per year, and those who earn less.</p>

<p>This project contains two notebooks: analysis_notebook and prediction_notebook. Either can be run independently of the other, 
and accomplish different objectives. The analysis notebook produces graphs and plots to describe the data in the dataset and includes
a brief discussion of some features. The prediction notebook manipulates the data to train machine learning models, and tests the models
on the test set.</p>

<p>Data should be extracted from the zip file and placed in a folder called 'census_income_data' within the project folder.
A deeper explanation of the dataset and its features is given in the metadeta document included in the zip file.</p>
